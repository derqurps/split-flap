# split-flap
This is a fork of the Split Flap Project by David Kingsman as seen here: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/69464-split-flap-display

My changes are mainly
- splt the files of the code for the master for easier readability
- add mqtt support
- fix some problem with passing umlaut as i built the umlaut version

I also used an wemos d1 clone instead of the esp01.
